# vyast-weaponDetection
A simple, lightweight FiveM resource that will stop players from using modified game files to gain an unfair combat advantage.

There are currently only two weapons listed in the config by default. Add as many weapons to this list as you would like to detect. 

The values inside the config need to be set to whatever values are active on your server, those being the default values from the default weapons.meta file, or if you are using a custom weapons.meta file on your server, you need to adjust the values accordingly.
